INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON:

python is the most easiest programming language in which a programmer could code fast and easy.
python is fun actually.
python was released in the year 1991 by GuidoVan Rossum, it's a high level language and interpreted one..

The datatypes in python are LIST,TUPLE,SET,STRING,DICTIONARY.. where string and tuple are immutable whereas remaining are mutable..

To simpilify the programming, we create small handeable units known as Modules like math module,random and matplotlib modules..
modules can contain functions, classes and objects, variables, statements, docstrings..

Python has OOPS concept such as CLASSES(blueprint to build object),
OBJECT(real world entity),
INHERITANCE(single,multilevel,multiple,hierarchical,hybrid),
POLYMORPHISM(operator overloading and overriding),
ENCAPSULATION(data hiding or abstraction)

Intresting thing is that Python also supports the GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE(GUI)..so that we can create animations with few lines of code compare to other languages.
It has tkinter module, it is the standard GUI library for python..
widgets are Button,Canvas,CheckButton,Entry,Frame,Listbox,Menu,MenuButton,Message,Radiobutton etc..


It has many support libraries like- TENSORFLOW,NUMPY,PANDAS,SCIPY,MATPLOTLIB etc..
It also supports multithreading concepts..

NUMPY is the library for creating n dimensional arrays in an easy and fast way.

PANDAS is a tool for DATAPROCESSING which helps in data analysis..It provides functions and methods to efficiently manipulate large datasets.

MATPLOTLIB is an open souce drawing library which supports reich drawing types(2D & 3D graphics)..
u can generate plots,histograms,bar charts and many other charts with just a fewlines of code.

Latest added library and the most useful one is SCIKIT..
it is simple and efficient tool for DATAMINING & DAAT ANALYSIS built on numpy, scipy and matplotlib libraries..

Atlast, DYANAMIC PROGRAMING is useful to handle time and space complexities..
It includes Recursion(Linear(Direct and Indirect) and Non Linear recursions)

DATASTRUCTURES in python which includes -
Built in Datastructures(LIST, DICTIONARY, TUPLE, SET) and
User defined Datastructures(STACK, QUEUE, TREE, LINKED LIST, GRAPH, HASHMAP)

Algorithm classes involves in -
1.Divide & Conquer
2.Dynamic Programming
3.Greedy algorithms

Sorting algorithms include MERGESORT, BUBBLESORT, INSERTIONSORT, SELECTION SORT, SHELL SHORT.
Searching algorithms include LINEAR SEARCH and BINARY SEARCH.
